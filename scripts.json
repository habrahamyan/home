    "description": "In this manuscript I carry out a two-loop calculation in scalar phi^3 that I did as homework at some point. The calculation is a good example of loop calculations in quantum field theory, as well as a nice demonstration of dimensional regularization and integration-by-parts identities (IBPs)."
